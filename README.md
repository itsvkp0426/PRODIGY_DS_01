### Task-01: Population Distribution Visualization

Internship: Data Science Internship – Prodigy InfoTech

---

### Objective
To visualize the distribution of a continuous population-related variable using appropriate graphical representations such as bar charts and distribution plots.

---

### Dataset
Source: World Population Dataset

Description:
The dataset contains country-wise population statistics across multiple years. It provides information about population size for different countries, which can be used to analyze global population distribution patterns.

---

### Data Preparation
- Loaded the population dataset using pandas.
- Selected population data for the year 2022.
- Removed missing values to ensure accurate visualization.

---

### Visualization Techniques
The following visualizations were created:

- A distribution plot (KDE plot) to visualize the overall distribution of population sizes across countries.
- A horizontal bar chart to represent the top 10 most populated countries in the year 2022.

---

### Observations
- The population distribution is highly right-skewed, indicating that a small number of countries account for a large proportion of the global population.
- Countries such as China and India dominate the population distribution compared to others.

---

### Conclusion
This task demonstrates how data visualization techniques can be used to understand the distribution of population-related variables. Such visual analysis helps in identifying global population patterns and comparing population sizes across countries effectively.
